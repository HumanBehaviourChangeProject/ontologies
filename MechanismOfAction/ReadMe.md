# Welcome to the repository for the Mechanism of Action (MoA) Ontology, part of the Behaviour Change Intervention Ontology (BCIO).

This repository contains ontology files describing mechanisms of action, the processes through which behaviour change interventions work to influence behaviours. 

# Overview of Files
* **BCIO-moa-hierarchy.xlsx:** A spreadsheet with the Mechanism of Action Ontology classes organised hierarchically for applications in behavioural sciences.
* **bcio_moa.owl:** The Mechanism of Action Ontology classes and their relations in OWL format.
* **bcio_moa.xlsx:** A spreadsheet with the Mechanism of Action Ontology classes and their relations.
  
# Instructions for Downloading and Accessing Ontology Files

There are three ways to download and view the Mechanism of Action Ontology:

# Method 1: Viewing the ontology in a simple spreadsheet format
1.	Download the file bcio_moa.xlsx.
2.	Open the file to view the ontology in a spreadsheet format, including class labels, definitions, parent classes, and additional information.

# Method 2: Viewing the ontology in a hierarchically organised spreadsheet format (for ontology beginners)
1.	Download the file BCIO-moa-hierarchy.xlsx.
2.	Open the file to view the ontology in a hierarchically structured format. This organisation is particularly useful for social and behavioural scientists, as it visually presents classes through parent-child relationships.

# Method 3: Using Protégé ontology software (for ontology experts)
1.	Download Protégé from https://protege.stanford.edu/ and open Protégé.exe.
2.	Download the file bcio_moa.owl and open it in Protégé.
3.	Note: When uploading this file, you may be prompted to resolve dependencies (e.g., bcio_upper_level.owl). These can be downloaded from the repository (e.g., see the file “Upper-level BCIO”) and uploaded to Protégé as needed.

# Additional Tools
* To browse the ontology, use the dedicated BCIO browser, BCIOSearch: https://www.bciosearch.org/.
* To visualise the ontology, visit the BCIO visualisation website, BCIOVisualise: https://bciovis.hbcptools.org/.
* To browse the Behaviour Change Intervention Ontology and other ontologies, use Ontology LookUp Service: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/bcio
