# Welcome to the repository for the Intervention Population Ontology, part of the Behaviour Change Intervention Ontology (BCIO).

This repository contains ontology files describing people participating in interventions and their attributes.

# Overview of Files
* **BCIO-population-hierarchy.xlsx:** A spreadsheet with the Intervention Population Ontology classes organised hierarchically for applications in behavioural sciences.
* **BCIO_Population.xlsx:** A spreadsheet with the Intervention Population Ontology classes and their relations.
* **BCIO_Population_Expanded.xlsx:** A spreadsheet with the complete Intervention Popualtion Ontology, expanded from the the BCIO_Population.xlsx version to include aggregates of relevant entities.
* **bcio_population.owl:** The expanded Intervention Population Ontology classes and their relations in OWL format.
  
# Instructions for Downloading and Accessing Ontology Files

There are three ways to download and view the Intervention Population Ontology:

# Method 1: Viewing the ontology in a simple spreadsheet format
1.	Download the file BCIO_Population.xlsx or, for more detail, the file BCIO_Population_Expanded.xlsx.
2.	Open the file to view the ontology in a spreadsheet format, including class labels, definitions, parent classes, and additional information.

# Method 2: Viewing the ontology in a hierarchically organised spreadsheet format (for ontology beginners)
1.	Download the file BCIO-population-hierarchy.xlsx.
2.	Open the file to view the ontology in a hierarchically structured format. This organisation is particularly useful for social and behavioural scientists, as it groups classes by parent-child relationships.

# Method 3: Using Protégé ontology software (for ontology experts)
1.	Download Protégé from https://protege.stanford.edu/ and open Protégé.exe.
2.	Download the file bcio_population.owl and open it in Protégé.
3.	Note: When uploading this file, you may be prompted to resolve dependencies (e.g., bcio_upper_level.owl). These can be downloaded from the repository (see the file “Upper-level BCIO”) and uploaded to Protégé as needed.

# Additional Tools
* To browse the ontology, use the dedicated BCIO browser, BCIOSearch: https://www.bciosearch.org/.
* To visualise the ontology, visit the BCIO visualisation website, BCIOVisualise: https://bciovis.hbcptools.org/.
* To browse the Behaviour Change Intervention Ontology and other ontologies, use Ontology LookUp Service: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/bcio
