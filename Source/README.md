# Welcome to the repository for the Intervention Source Ontology of the Behaviour Change Intervention Ontology (BCIO). 
This contains ontology files describing the people, populations or organisations that provide behaviour change interventions.

# Overview of Files
* **BCIO-source-hierarchy.xlsx:** A spreadsheet with the Intervention Source Ontology classes organised hierarchically for applications in behavioural sciences.
* **bcio_source.owl:** The Intervention Source Ontology classes and their relations in OWL format.
* **bcio_source.xlsx:** A spreadsheet with the Intervention Source Ontology classes and their relations.

# Instructions for Downloading and Accessing Ontology Files

There are three ways to download and view the Intervention Source Ontology:

# Method 1: Viewing the ontology in a simple spreadsheet format
1.	Download the file bcio_source.xlsx.
2.	Open the file to view the ontology in a spreadsheet format, including class labels, definitions, parent classes, and additional information.

# Method 2: Viewing the ontology in a hierarchically organised spreadsheet format (for ontology beginners)
1.	Download the file BCIO-source-hierarchy.xlsx.
2.	Open the file to view the ontology in a hierarchically structured format. This organisation is particularly useful for social and behavioural scientists, as it groups classes by parent-child relationships.

# Method 3: Using Protégé ontology software (for ontology experts)
1.	Download Protégé from https://protege.stanford.edu/ and open Protégé.exe.
2.	Download the file bcio_source.owl and open it in Protégé.
3.	Note: When uploading this file, you may be prompted to resolve dependencies (e.g., bcio_upper_level.owl). These can be downloaded from the repository (see the file “Upper-level BCIO”) and uploaded to Protégé as needed.

# Additional Tools
* To browse the ontology, use the dedicated BCIO browser, BCIOSearch: https://www.bciosearch.org/.
* To visualise the ontology, visit the BCIO visualisation website, BCIOVisualise: https://bciovis.hbcptools.org/.
* To browse the Behaviour Change Intervention Ontology and other ontologies, use Ontology LookUp Service: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/bcio
