# Welcome to the repository for Upper Level of the Behaviour Change Intervention Ontology (BCIO). 
This contains the overall structure of the Behaviour Change Intervention Ontology, including its upper-level classes, relations and classes imported from other ontologies. 

# Overview of Files
* **bcio.owl:** A spreadsheet with the complete Behaviour Change Intervention Ontology classes and their relations in OWL format.
* **bcio_external.owl:** A spreadsheet with Behaviour Change Intervention Ontology classes that were imported from other ontologies in OWL format.
* **bcio_relations.owl:** A spreadsheet with the relations used in the Behaviour Change Intervention Ontology in OWL format.
* **bcio_upper_level.owl:** A spreadsheet with the Upper-level Behaviour Change Intervention Ontology classes and their relations in OWL format.

# Instructions for Downloading and Accessing Ontology Files

To download and view the files for the Behaviour Change Intervention Ontology (BCIO), its relations, upper level structure and externally imported classes in the OWL format use **Protégé ontology software**. This requires you to:
1.	Download Protégé from https://protege.stanford.edu/ and open Protégé.exe.
2.	Download the relevant file (bcio.owl, bcio_external.owl, bcio_relations.owl **OR** bcio_upper_level.owl) and open it in Protégé.
3.	Note: When uploading this file, you may be prompted to resolve dependencies (e.g., bcio_upper_level.owl). These can be downloaded from the repository and uploaded to Protégé as needed.

# Additional Tools
* To browse the ontology, use the dedicated BCIO browser, BCIOSearch: https://www.bciosearch.org/.
* To visualise the ontology, visit the BCIO visualisation website, BCIOVisualise: https://bciovis.hbcptools.org/.
* To browse the Behaviour Change Intervention Ontology and other ontologies, use Ontology LookUp Service: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/bcio
