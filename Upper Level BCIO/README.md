# Welcome to the repository for Upper Level of the Behaviour Change Intervention Ontology (BCIO). 
This contains the overall structure of the Behaviour Change Intervention Ontology. 

# Instructions for downloading Upper Level ontology  
There are 2 ways of accessing and viewing the Upper Level BCIO: 

# Method 1. Using WebVOWL: an Online Visualisation Tool (for ontology beginners) 
WebVOWL is a useful online tool for visualizing ontologies in owl format. You can view a diagram of the HBCP ontologies, showing all relations and definitions, using webVOWL.
1. Visit the website http://visualdataweb.de/webvowl/  
2. Copy this URL: http://humanbehaviourchange.org/ontology/bcio_upper_level.owl  
    Tip: Ensure there is no space at the end of the URL or you will get an error 
3. Hover on “Ontology” at the bottom of the screen, paste the URL copied during step two into the Custom Ontology: Enter Ontology IRI field, and click ‘Visualize’.  
4. You should now be able to view the ontology. You can zoom in and out, and can also click on entities/and relationships to view more information about them (definitions etc.) in the right hand pane.  

# Method 2. Using Protégé ontology software (for those proficient in ontologies) 
1. Download Protégé https://protege.stanford.edu/ and open Protégé.exe  
2. Click File, Open from URL, enter http://humanbehaviourchange.org/ontology/bcio_upper_level.owl
