# BCIO Contribution Guide


**Call details**
BCIO Development meetings take place every last Tuesday of each month, 10:00 CT / 16:00 GMT / 17:00 CET. The meetings are open to the public. In the meetings, we will go over open issues from the GitHub issue tracker and attempt to find solutions. The meeting takes 1 hour.

Zoom: https://uzh.zoom.us/j/61093036677?pwd=NMuqCQCxFbkqlKXfby3IM4d5e4dSaq.1    
Agenda: https://cryptpad.fr/doc/#/2/doc/edit/fceT7KN7D69+AMxiexGfi6SC/ 
Issue Tracker: https://github.com/HumanBehaviourChangeProject/ontologies/issues

Suggestions for the BCIO can be made using the GitHub issue tracker. This requires creation of a (free) GitHub account. We use this method as it is transparent. 

## Guidelines for creating GitHub tickets with contributions to the ontology
*	**Follow the template.** We provide templates for different kinds of requests, including new term requests, changes to entities and other issues. Please follow the templates to make it as easy as possible for us to process your request.
*	**New term requests.** Does the term already exist? Before submitting suggestions for new ontology terms, check whether the term exists, either as a primary term or a synonym term. You can search using bcio search or OLS.
*	**New term request.** Be sure to provide suggestions for label (name), definition, references, position in hierarchy, etc.
*	**Be detailed.** Please be specific and include as many details as necessary, providing background information, and if possible, suggesting a solution. We will be better equipped to address your suggestions if you offer details regarding 'what is wrong', 'why', and 'how to fix it'. 
*	**Provide examples and references.** Please include references (ideally DOIs) for new term requests or changes where possible. For problems with ontology tools, please include screenshots. This will be very helpful to us, as everyone's settings may be different for their browser/editor.
*	**For updates to relationships.** Provide details of the current relationships, why you think they are wrong or not sufficient, and what exactly should be added or removed.
*	**Be responsive.** Tickets with insufficient detail may be followed up with additional queries within GitHub – please try to reply to our questions swiftly. 

## How will your requests be processed?

The processing of requests happens in multiple steps.

*	The issue will be assigned to a BCIO team member
*	If necessary, they will ask additional questions
*	Once the issue is clear, it will be scheduled in an upcoming open BCIO monthly meeting. Anyone is very welcome to join this meeting to discuss the scheduled requests. It is particularly helpful for us if the person creating the discussed issues are present.
*	Once the issue has been discussed, we will update the issue regarding the decisions made during the meeting.
*	We will wait one week for possible objections to this solution. 
*	We will then update the ontology, tagging and closing the current issue. 
*	If you believe the issue is not adequately resolved, please let us know as soon as possible.
