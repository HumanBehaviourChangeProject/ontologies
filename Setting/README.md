# Welcome to the repository for the Intervention Setting Ontology of the Behaviour Change Intervention Ontology (BCIO). 
This contains ontology files describing where a behaviour change intervention takes place. 

# Overview of Files
* **BCIO-setting-hierarchy.xlsx:** A spreadsheet with the Intervention Setting Ontology classes organised hierarchically for applications in behavioural sciences.
* **bcio_setting.owl:** The Intervention Setting Ontology classes and their relations in OWL format.
* **bcio_setting.xlsx:** A spreadsheet with the Intervention Setting Ontology classes and their relations.


# Instructions for Downloading and Accessing Ontology Files

There are three ways to download and view the Intervention Setting Ontology:

# Method 1: Viewing the ontology in a simple spreadsheet format
1.	Download the file bcio_setting.xlsx.
2.	Open the file to view the ontology in a spreadsheet format, including class labels, definitions, parent classes, and additional information.

# Method 2: Viewing the ontology in a hierarchically organised spreadsheet format (for ontology beginners)
1.	Download the file BCIO-setting-hierarchy.xlsx.
2.	Open the file to view the ontology in a hierarchically structured format. This organisation is particularly useful for social and behavioural scientists, as it groups classes by parent-child relationships.

# Method 3: Using Protégé ontology software (for ontology experts)
1.	Download Protégé from https://protege.stanford.edu/ and open Protégé.exe.
2.	Download the file bcio_setting.owl and open it in Protégé.
3.	Note: When uploading this file, you may be prompted to resolve dependencies (e.g., bcio_upper_level.owl). These can be downloaded from the repository (see the file “Upper-level BCIO”) and uploaded to Protégé as needed.

# Additional Tools
* To browse the ontology, use the dedicated BCIO browser, BCIOSearch: https://www.bciosearch.org/.
* To visualise the ontology, visit the BCIO visualisation website, BCIOVisualise: https://bciovis.hbcptools.org/.
* To browse the Behaviour Change Intervention Ontology and other ontologies, use Ontology LookUp Service: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/bcio
